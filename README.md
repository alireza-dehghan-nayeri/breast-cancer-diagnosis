# breast-cancer-diagnosis

A project to predict risk of breast cancer for women

After searching about applications that estimate the risk of breast cancer I found two applications on Google Play Store and none in Cafe Bazzar store.

I found some related papres about data mining and it's use in breas cancer diagnosis wich is uploaded to this repo.

##### Features of this project:

1: A backend service to store and send json files which is used to draw dynamic forms from

2: A backend service to store and send user data and returns the risk to user 

3: A frontend App for android devices which uses the json file to draw dynamic form and be used to show the risk of cancer to users

4: A data mining method to preprocess, classify and predict the risk of cancer by using local and foreign breas cancer data

5: A paper to determine and find the best method of data mining for this specific task which increase the accurecy of prediction

### 1: Json storage backend service

this backend service consists of a storage and post, get, del methods to recive and send the json files

### 2: App backend service

this backend service gets the user data and after saving it returns the risk

### 3: The Android App

this android app uses the json file from the first backend service to draw the form which user should complete. the data will be sent to the second service to be processed the returnd amount of risk will be shown to the user and the proper instructions will be given

### 4: The Data Mining Method

this method should be accurate enough so after reading the papers and selecting the best method and increasing the accuracy it should be applied to the data sets

### 5: The Review Paper

this paper will be a review of the selected papers in this repo it will show the method chosen for this project and its advantages over other methods and the outcome
